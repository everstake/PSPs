The timing of our PSP was imperfect to say the least since we initiated call for feedback at the time when most of the devs are preparing for the Polkadot mainnet launch and simply didn’t have time to review our PSP. So, I’m not sure how useful our feedback is going to be.

In general, since this process is still new and not yet established, it lacks clarity in terms of goals, deliverables and mechanics of the process overall. Here are some of the questions we had to answer for ourselves when working on the PSP. Note, this is our experience while yours can be different; we’re posting it here because we think it might help someone in the same situation.
1. **Who are the audience of our PSP, regular users or devs? Should the language of the PSP be more general or technical?** Ours was purely technical and I think we should have explained certain things in a simpler fashion.
2. **What is the best way media channels and format for sharing with community?** We ended up with googledocs and medium and shared it in several Riot groups, TG chat and twitter.
3. **How long do we collect the feedback for and how often do we ‘remind’ people of our PSP?** We did one month and posted our call for feedback 5 times during this period.
4. **What are the criteria for the amount of feedback collected?** Because of the afore-mentioned reasons we were happy with any feedback.
5. **How do decide which feedback is the most relevant?** We were guided by common sense, just trying to understand the amount of value added by suggestions.

We ended up calling our proposal PSP-2 because most of the existing PSPs don’t have a number attached to them. This can also be confusing a bit especially for somebody doing it for the first time.
